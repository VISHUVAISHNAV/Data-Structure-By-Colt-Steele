## Introduction

This repository is created and maintained by **Vishu Vaishnav**. It includes implementations of common data structures and algorithms, along with example problems and solutions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive reference and practice resource for students, developers, and anyone interested in computer science.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Implementation of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and hash tables.
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of sorting algorithms, searching algorithms,greedy algorithms, and more.
- **Code Examples**: Practical code examples and problem-solving techniques.
- **Multiple Languages**: Implementations in Python.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd data-structures-and-algorithms
    ```
3. Choose the language directory and explore the implementations.

## Usage
